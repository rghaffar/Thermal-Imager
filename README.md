# Thermal-Imager
This project consists of modules in Python that capture and record thermal images/videos
as well as extract, process, and display pixel data.

Thermal pixel data was flattened to extract and display R, G, B, and greyscale data in the form of images and histograms
Modules were also created to adjust the contrast of images, apply a Gaussian blur filter, and apply the Sobel operator for edge detection

# Getting Started
Software required - Python development environment (I used Anaconda)
Hardware required - thermal camera (I used a portable Flir camera) 

# Deployment
Connect thermal camera to PC and run Python scripts to display and capture thermal video/images 
Run Python scripts that process saved thermal images: extract pixel data into respective RGB and greyscale components, 
apply smoothing/edge detection/contrast, and display post-processed histograms/images
